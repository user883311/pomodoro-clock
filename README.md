# pomodoro-clock
## a freecodecamp project

Objective: Build a website app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/aNyxXR/.

User Story: 
- I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
- I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
- I can customize the length of each pomodoro.

Source: https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-pomodoro-clock

Idea for CSS animations: 
- drop a curtain
- raindrops fill a water tank
- add light theme, other colors

Notes: I used a single-thread timer as a common reference for the several events.
