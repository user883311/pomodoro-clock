# pomodoro-clock
a freecodecamp project

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/aNyxXR/.

User Story: 
- I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
- I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
- I can customize the length of each pomodoro.

Idea for CSS animation: 
- drop a curtain
- raindrops fill a water tank

Notes: I needed a single threaded timer to run these several tasks. 

Tickets: 
- curtain doesn't reset properly after using +/ - buttons
